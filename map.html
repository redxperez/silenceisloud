            <p>Northern Hemisphere are often dominated by industrial shippings with roughly 50,000 vessels sailing a day. With the ships producing frequencies in the range 10-200hz contirubiting a high intense ambiant noise and this, largely affects marine species' communication and migration.It also highlights long-term patterns that link growing human activity to rising ocean noise. Underwater sound pollution is also exacerbated by industrial noise from offshore oil and gas exploration.
