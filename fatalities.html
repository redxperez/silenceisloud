            <h1>FATALITIES</h1>
            <p>Among the 10,000 studies conducted, many have focused on the impact of seismic surveys and sonar on marine mammals. These sounds cause significant distress to species like dolphins, often forcing them to ascend too quickly, which leads to decompression sickness and fatal gas bubbles forming in their tissues. Due to these noises, whales tend to separate from their groups and become disoriented, resulting in strandings on beaches. In Sri Lanka alone, over 100 whales have been stranded, with human-made noise being the primary cause.

            <p>For isntance, Kunc et al. (2016) show how noise impacts on behavior such as compromised
communication, orientation, feeding, parental care, and prey detection, and increased aggression, can
lead to less group cohesion, avoidance of important habitat, fewer offspring, and higher death rates. </p>
