            <h1>Noise level</h1>
            <p>40% of the noise level comes from industrial shipping, with roughly 90,000 commercial vessels sailing daily. For about 10 per cent, oil and gas production uses techniques such as directional drilling, which produces around 190-220 decibels, 30 per cent higher than the safe amount of decibels most marine animals can take. 
            
            </p>
            
            <p>Taking up 10% of the noise produced, seismic surveys produces low and high frequency sounds which are both bad for the animals, as low frequencies can harm crustaceans and high intensity ones hurts most animals.  </p>
